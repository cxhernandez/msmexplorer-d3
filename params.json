{"name":"MSMExplorer-d3","tagline":"A d3.js-based webtool for analysis and interactive visualization of transition state pathways.","body":"MSMExplorer-d3\r\n=================\r\n\r\nA d3.js-based webapp powered by tornado that allows for analysis and interactive visualizations of transition state pathways (TPs).\r\n\r\n![MSMExplorer](https://raw.github.com/cxhernandez/msmexplorer-d3/master/images/example.png)\r\n\r\nBefore You Begin\r\n----------------\r\nBefore using MSMExplorer-d3.js, you will need to install MongoDb, pymongo, tornado, Heroku, and their respective requirements. MSMBuilder and NetworkX will eventually be needed to generate the graphs, but for now as long as you have a JSON formatted file with directed graph data this web application should work just fine.\r\n\r\n\r\nStarting up the MSMExplorer-d3 on ``localhost``\r\n----------------\r\nJust enter the following into your terminal (while in the ``msmexplorer-d3`` trajectory):\r\n\r\n````\r\n$> mongod &\r\n$> python app.py -p 8000\r\n````\r\n\r\nNow you can fire up your favorite javascript-enabled browser and go to ``localhost:8000`` to see the app in action.\r\n\r\nUse for Analysis\r\n----------------\r\nAt the moment, the app is pretty much useless on its own (but it's pretty!). However, you can easily generate a JSON representation of your TPs using the supplied iPython Notebook session in [``public/gen_json_graph.ipynb``](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/cxhernandez/msmexplorer-d3/blob/master/public/gen_json_graph.ipynb).\r\n\r\nOnce you have a JSON-formatted network file, you can just drag and drop it into the webapp, and have the pathway visualization dynamically update. \r\n\r\nTodo\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nIn the future, I hope to provide additional functionalities:\r\n\r\n+ Upload a metric to stratify the pathways for more meaningful analysis.\r\n+ Upload transition matrix, sources, and sinks on the the fly and get a network,\r\n+ Visualize whole MSM networks\r\n\r\nShoutouts\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n- [d3.js](http://d3js.org/)\r\n- [tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/)\r\n- [mongodb](http://www.mongodb.org/)\r\n- [jquery-file-upload](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload)\r\n- [@rmcgibbo](https://github.com/rmcgibbo)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
