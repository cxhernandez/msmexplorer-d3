{"name":"MSMExplorer-d3","tagline":"A d3.js-based webtool for analysis and interactive visualization of transition state pathways.","body":"MSMExplorer-d3\r\n=================\r\n\r\nA d3.js-based webapp powered by tornado that creates beautiful interactive visualizations of MSM data.\r\n\r\n![MSMExplorer](https://raw.github.com/cxhernandez/msmexplorer-d3/master/images/example.png)\r\n\r\nBefore You Begin\r\n----------------\r\nBefore using MSMExplorer-d3.js, you will should install ``numpy``,``scipy``,``mongodb``, ``pymongo``, ``tornado``, ``heroku-toolbelt``,``newrelic``, ``networkx``, and their respective requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\nStarting up MSMExplorer-d3 on ``localhost``\r\n----------------\r\nJust enter the following into your terminal (while in the ``msmexplorer-d3`` trajectory):\r\n\r\n````\r\n$> mongod &\r\n$> python app.py\r\n````\r\n\r\nNow you can fire up your favorite javascript-enabled browser and go to ``localhost:5000`` to see the app in action.\r\n\r\nUse for Analysis\r\n----------------\r\nOnce you've built your MSM, you can just drag and drop a Matrix Market file (``mtx``) into the webapp, and start visualizing the graph immediately. You can also go to the ``Transition Paths`` tab to generate the N most-likely paths from source states to sink states. Please note that pathway generation can take a few seconds.\r\n\r\nTodo\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nIn the future, I hope to provide additional functionalities:\r\n\r\n+ Upload a metric to stratify the pathways for more meaningful analysis.\r\n+ Add more coloring options.\r\n+ Save results to a JSON file.\r\n\r\nShoutouts\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n- [d3.js](http://d3js.org/)\r\n- [backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/)\r\n- [bootbox.js](http://bootboxjs.com/)\r\n- [tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/)\r\n- [mongodb](http://www.mongodb.org/)\r\n- [Heroku buildpack for sklearn](https://github.com/dbrgn/heroku-buildpack-python-sklearn)\r\n- [msmbuilder](http://msmbuilder.org/)\r\n- [@rmcgibbo](https://github.com/rmcgibbo)\r\n- [Pande Group](http://pande.stanford.edu/)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
