<div id="system-nb_method-help">
Method for dealing with long range non-bondend interactions. Refer to the user guide for a detailed discussion.
</div>

<div id="system-nb_cutoff-help">
Cutoff for long-range non-bonded interactions. This option is important for all non-bonded methods except for "NoCutoff"
</div>

<div id="system-ewald_error_tolerance-help">
The error tolerance is roughly equal to the fractional error in the forces due to truncating the Ewald summation.
</div>

<div id="system-constraints-help">
Applying constraints to some of the atoms can enable you to take longer timesteps.
</div>

<div id="system-constraint_error_tol-help">
Tolerance within which constraints are maintained, as a fraction of the constrained distance.
</div>

<div id="system-rigid_water-help">
Be aware that flexible water may require you to further reduce the integration step size, typically to about 0.5 fs.
</div>

<div id="system-random_initial_velocities-help">
Initialize the system with random initial velocities, drawn from the Maxwell Boltzmann distribution

<div id="integrator-kind-help">
OpenMM offers a choice of several different integration methods. Refer to the user guide for details.
</div>

<div id="integrator-timestep-help">
Timestep for the integrator.
</div>

<div id="integrator-tolerance-help">
It is best not to think of this value as having any absolute meaning.Just think of it as an adjustable parameter that affects the step size and integration accuracy. Smaller values will produce a smaller average step size. You should try different values to find the largest one that produces a trajectory sufficiently accurate for your purposes.
</div>

<div id="integrator-friction-help">
Friction coefficient, for use with stochastic integrators or the Anderson thermostat.
</div>

<div id="integrator-temperature-help">
Temperature of the heat bath, used either by a stochastic integrator or the Andersen thermostat to establish and maintain a constant temperature ensemble.
</div>

<div id="integrator-barostat-help">
Activate a barostat for pressure coupling. The Monte Carlo barostat uses a Monte Carlo algorithm to adjust the size of the periodic box, simulating the effect of constant pressure. The MC barostat assumes the simulation is also being run at constant temperature. It does not actually perform temperature regulation, however. You must use another mechanism along with it to maintain the temperature. Note that pressure coupling is not appropriate for non-periodic simulations, e.g. implicit solvent.
</div>

<div id="integrator-pressure-help">
Pressure target, used by a barostat.
</div>

<div id="integrator-barostat_step-help">
The frequency (in time steps) at which Monte Carlo pressure changes should be attempted.
</div>

<div id="integrator-thermostat-help">
Activate a thermostat to maintain a constant temperature simulation.
</div>

<div id="simulation-equil_steps-help">
Number of steps of equilibration to run, prior to attaching reporters 
and running production.
</div>

<div id="simulation-prod_steps-help">
Number of steps of production simulation to run.
</div>

<div id="simulation-minimize-help">
Perform local energy minimization, to find a local potential energy minimum near the starting structure. It is usually needed to do one of these calculations before attempting MD, because the process of solvating your initial solute structure usually introduces some bad contacts that need to be relaxed before you attempt to heat the system.
</div>


<div id="simulation-minimize_iters-help">
The minimizer will exit once the specified number of iterations is reached, even if the energy has not yet converged. If you do not specify this parameter, the minimizer will continue until convergence is reached, no matter how many iterations it takes.
</div>

<div id="simulation-dcd_reporter-help">
DCDReporter outputs a series of frames from a Simulation to a DCD file.
</div>

<div id="simulation-dcd_freq-help">
Frequency, in steps, to save the state to disk in the DCD format.
</div>

<div id="simulation-dcd_file-help">
