    * Expected behavior of the Backone.Model subclasses
    * -------------------------------------------------
    *
    * javascript doesn't support the kind of class-based OO that I'm familiar
    * with, so we can't just extend Backbone.Model to make a base class, and
    * then extend that further.
    *
    * So I'll just write the API for our models here, as a comment:
    *
    * el : string
    *     a jquery selector for the DOM element where this model should be
    *     rendered, as a form.
    * name : string
    *     a string giving the name of the class. this is used by the "view" to
    *     create the script, in views.js
    * schema : dict
    *     schema for the model, i.e. what fields it has, what type they, are, etc
    *     this information is directly interpreted by Backbone.Forms, and its
    *     format is described here: https://github.com/powmedia/backbone-forms.
    *     the keys in this schema should be called the model's "attributes".
    *     They're not the only methods defined on the model class, but they _ARE_
    *     the things that get directly displayed to the user in the forms.
    * visibility : dict
    *     a dict of functions -- the keys in this dict should be the model's
    *     attributes. the functions take a single argument, which is a dict of
    *     the model's current attributes (mapping to their current values)
    *     and returns a bool, specifying whether this attribute should be
    *     shown or hidden to the user inside of the form.
    * defaults : dict
    *     a dict giving the default value for each of the attributes in the schema
    */
